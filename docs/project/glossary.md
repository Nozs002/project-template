# Purpose

This document defines the common terminology used throughout the project.

All documentation, architecture, APIs, source code, tests, and AI agents should

# Maintenance

This glossary should be updated whenever:

- A new business term is introduced.
- A new module is created.
- A new architectural concept is adopted.
- Naming conventions change.
